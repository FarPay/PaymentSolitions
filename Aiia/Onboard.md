## Onboard *Aiia FI* as a Payment Solution

After completing the initial onboarding, proceed with the manual onboarding specifically for Aiia FI. This involves filling out a form.


### Required Form
The onboarding form is available in both Danish and English languages:

- [English Form - Download](https://github.com/FarPay/PaymentSolutions/raw/main/Aiia/forms/fik_giro_en.docx)

Certain fields within the form can be filled out by FarPay Support (e.g., Company Name, Address, Number). Hence, the forms are provided in Microsoft Word format (.docx). FarPay Support will complete the applicable fields, save the form as a .pdf, and send it to the company for further completion.


### Submission Process
Once the form is completed and signed by the company, it should be emailed to aiia.kyc@mastercard.com for the KYC process.

### Completion Confirmation
Upon completion of the KYC process, MasterCard will provide a "DestinationId" via email to the company. The company must then provide this DestinationId to FarPay Support. Once this step is done, the Aiia Onboarding process is complete.
